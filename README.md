# Classification of Damaging Agents in Soybean Leaflets

Many of the difficulties in managing soybean tillage are related to the identification of insect/pests harmful to the plant, since tillage can be attacked by a wide range of such agents. By identifying the most common agents that cause damages to the leaflets, we can obtain more knowledge about appropriate strategies of control.

This project presents a method for classification of main agents that cause damages to soybean leaflets, i.e., beetles and caterpillars.
